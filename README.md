# INSIGHTS AND RECCOMMENDATIONS
 1. The business generated a total of $23M is sales in 2 years.

 2. Although profits increased by 4.5%, sales went down almost 1% in 2022.
The company could easily have made more if it had matched 2021 sales.
The reasons for the drop in sales should be investigated

 3. The bestselling category by far proved to be Office supplies (60%).
It is also the most profitable (60%).
The company should consider going all in on office supplies.

 4. Worst performing products should be dropped.

 5. Average order value (AOV) can be increased by incentivizing the purchase process in order to make customers spend more.

 6. Customers who spent the most should be recognized and made long-term loyal customers to boost revenue.

 7. The company's marketing activities should be increased in the 5 states which generated the most revenue:
California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

 8. 54.8% (62051) of orders were delivered late.
That could easily have resulted in lost revenue for the company.
Clearly, this needs to be worked on.
The reasons for the late deliveries should be investigated and addressed.

 9. Canceled orders accounted for 4.3% of all orders.
It should be as low as possible.
